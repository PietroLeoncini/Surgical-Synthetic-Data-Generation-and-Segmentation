# YOLO Models for detection and segmentation

## Overview
This folder contains YOLO.pt models for object detection and segmentation in the context described in the paper 

## Contents:
1. **Yolov8m-TypeBased-Detection**: Detection Model which detects tools in Type-based format, the one described as 'Model 4' in the paper 'A reproducible framework for synthetic data generastion and instance segmentation in robotic suturing'
2. **Yolov8m-TypeBased-Segmentation**: Segmentation Model which segments tools in Type-based format, the one described as 'Model 4' in the paper 'A reproducible framework for synthetic data generastion and instance segmentation in robotic suturing'
3. **Yolo11m-TURBO-TypeBased**: Segmentation Model which segments tools in Type-based format, the one described in the paper 'Generative AI Pipeline with Model-Guided Filtering for Sim-to-Real Transfer in Surgical Imaging' (manuscript under revision)
4. **Yolo11m-TURBO-PartBased**: Segmentation Model which segments tools in Part-based format, the one described as 'Model 4' in the paper 'Generative AI Pipeline with Model-Guided Filtering for Sim-to-Real Transfer in Surgical Imaging' (manuscript under revision)
