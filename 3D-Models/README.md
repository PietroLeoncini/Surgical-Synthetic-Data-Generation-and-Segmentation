# 3D Models for Robotic Suturing Automation

## Overview
This folder contains task-specific 3D models designed to simulate surgical scenarios for robotic suturing. These models were created and modified using [Shapr3D](https://www.shapr3d.com/), focusing on maintaining only the visible portions relevant for computer vision tasks.

## Contents
- **Da-Vinci-Tools**: Modified to include open, closed, bent-open and bent-closed tip configurations, to increase variability.
    - **Cadiere Forceps**
    - **Needle Driver**
    - **Potts Scissors**
- **Surgical Needle**
- **Tissue-Cuts**: Six distinct tissue models, including various incision shapes, to represent diverse surgical contexts, increasing variability.

## Usage
These 3D models are compatible with Unity and can be imported as `.obj` files for use in virtual environments. They are useful for generating synthetic datasets with the Unity Perception package.
