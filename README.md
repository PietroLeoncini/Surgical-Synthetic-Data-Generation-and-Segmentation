# Surgical-Synthetic-Data-Generation-and-Segmentation

This repository contains resources developed for robotic suturing automation:

- **3D Models**: Task-specific models for robotic tools and tissues.
- **Unity Environments**: Simulated surgical scenarios with varying levels of realism.
- **Datasets**: Annotated datasets generated in Unity, including bounding boxes and instance segmentation txt files.
- **Instance Segmentation Model**: A YOLOv8m-based model trained for surgical tool instance segmentation.

## Usage Instructions

1. Download the Unity environments and import them into your Unity project to create new annotated images or modify these environments.
2. Use the datasets for training or fine-tuning your own models or testing pre-trained models.
3. The instance segmentation model is provided in [model directory]. Instructions for usage are included.
